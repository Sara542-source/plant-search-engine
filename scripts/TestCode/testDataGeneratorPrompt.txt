You are helping evaluate an information retrieval system (plant search engine).
I will give you the content of 95 plant documents.
Your goal is to generate realistic search queries AND their expected relevant documents ( maximu nbr of documents please )

Rules:

Each query must be something a real user might search.

It can involve symptoms of plants (yellow leaves, pests, fungal diseases)

Or cultivation (watering, spacing, soil type)

Or scientific/technical terms

Or a mix of general + specific vocabulary

For every query, list the document titles that are relevant.

Relevance means the document talks about the plant or concept mentioned.
The queries must test different aspects:

✔ scientific terms (e.g., “acarien traitement”)

✔ French agricultural vocabulary (“arrosage modéré”, “substrat riche en humus”)

✔ multi-word scientific expressions (“alternariose du solanum melongena”)

✔ symptoms (“feuilles qui jaunissent en été”)

✔ general queries (“plantes aromatiques pour la cuisine”)

✔ difficult ambiguous queries (“maladie noire des feuilles”)

Output format (strict JSON list):

[
  {
    "query": "QUERY STRING HERE",
    "relevant_documents": ["doc_title_1", "doc_title_2", "..."]
  }
]


Generate 100 queries, varied and high-quality that expect a micture of docs ( json and pdfs)

I gave you all 95 documents (a mix of JSON and PDFs).
Extract plant names, scientific names, technical terms, diseases, cultivation rules, pests, etc.
Then generate the evaluation queries.
